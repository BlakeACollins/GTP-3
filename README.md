# GTP-3

Building a modern UX/UI for GTP-3. Made with React and CSS. In this project I learned the following: 
- React functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental #CSS properties to master flex & grid
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost all devices
- And at the end, you'll learn how to deploy your websites to extremely fast servers and give them a custom domain name.
